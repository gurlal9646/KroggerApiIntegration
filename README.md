# KroggerApiIntegration
For this project, I used public APIs from Kroger developer to create an HTML page using JavaScript's Fetch API concept. The goal of the project was to build a web page that could retrieve data from the Kroger APIs and display it on the page.

To achieve this, I first had to research the available APIs on the Kroger developer website and select the ones that would be most useful for my project. Once I had identified the APIs, I used JavaScript's Fetch API to retrieve data from them.

After retrieving the data, I used JavaScript to parse the JSON response and display the relevant information on the HTML page. This included details such as product names, prices, and availability.

To improve the user experience, I also added some styling and interactive features using CSS and JavaScript. For example, I added a search bar that allowed users to search for specific products and a filter option that allowed them to sort the products by price or availability.

Overall, this project was a great way to learn about using public APIs and implementing them in a web page. It also helped me to develop my skills in JavaScript and HTML, as well as improving my understanding of the Fetch API concept.
